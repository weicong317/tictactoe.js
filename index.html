				<h2>About Ironman</h2>
				<p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity.</p>
				<p>Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.</p>

						<h2>Latest Armor</h2>
						<img src="./image/mark50.png" alt="Mark 50" />
						<p>The Mark 50 is Tony Starkâ€™s fiftieth Iron Man suit. It was built after the Mark 47. The Information about Mark 48 and 49 is still unconfirmed, however Kevin Feige confirmed that this armor is named as the Mark 50. It is used to battle Thanos and his allies.</p>
						<p>This armor is more advanced than any other previous armors, directly attached to the arc reactor on Tony's Chest, it possesses many capabilities and useful functions for Tony to use at his disposal. Like the Marks 45, 46, and 47, this armor has the F.R.I.D.A.Y OS built into it and possesses some of the most advanced technology and weapons compared to other armors Tony Stark has built.</p>
						<p>The Mark 50 can use built-in nano booster wings for a boost in speed and stabilized flight when needed. It also has a nanotech beam mounted in the left and right arm which can be used to shoot a beam of nanotech, which can be used to repair or build. Tony uses this beam to stop Thanos from closing his fist to use the Infinity Stones, as well as healing the stab wound in his abdomen when Thanos stabs him.</p>

						<h3>3 Armor's Features</h3>
						<h4>Nanotechnology</h4>
						<p>The Mark 50 features a very advanced Nanotechnology beyond its predecessors, the Mark 46 and Mark 47. This Nanotechnology seems to be similar to Wakandan tech, but this theory has not been confirmed yet.</p>
						<h4>Deformable</h4>
						<p>Mark 50 can be completely disintegrated and stored within the special compartment within the Arc Reactor, with its advanced Nanotechnology. Tony usually uses this technology to partially remove the helmet for comfortable vision.</p>
						<h4>Integrated Control Interface</h4>
						<p>Despite F.R.I.D.A.Y OS disconnected from the Suit when Tony left the Earth's stratosphere due to the lack of internet connection, he was able to normally operate the suit's various functions. This suggests that the suit has an integrated control system that allows the user to control the suit without any AI assistance.</p>
